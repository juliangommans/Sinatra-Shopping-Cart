# Personal Projects

This repository is part of the Personal Project series for Phase 2. This is 1 of the 3 Personal Projects for this phase. These projects are intentionally open ended but aim to cover all the Learning Competencies with your project. The instructors are available to answer any questions you have around these projects.

## Submission Process

1. Clone this repository.
2. Create a branch with your name.
3. Copy or create your starter code (Sinatra Skeleton or ASP.NET MVC) in the repository's root directory.
4. Commit and push up to origin.
5. Create a pull request.
6. Tag an instructor on your pull request for review or when you are done.

# Server Side App

The goal of this Personal Project is to build a server side web application. For Rubyists this means you will be basing your project off of the [Sinatra Skeleton](../../../sinatra-skeleton-mvc-challenge) and for Sharpies this will mean creating a new ASP.NET MVC app in Visual Studio.

### Learning Competencies

The things we will be looking to see if you have learned in this project are:

  - **Implement CRUD in a MVC application**
  - **Unit testing**
  - **Controller testing**
  - Use an `Active Record` | `Entity Framework` to perform CRUD operations on a database
  - Use `Active Record` | `Entity Framework` Migrations
  - Use `Active Record` | `Entity Framework` Queries
  - Use `Active Record` | `Entity Framework` to create Associations between database tables
  - Implement user login and authentication
  - Use Semantic HTML to structure a website
  - Use CSS selectors to efficiently select any DOM element
  - Understand different CSS selectors and CSS specificity and design your CSS to optimize these
  - Change basic CSS appearance: colours, widths, padding, margin
  - Position elements using CSS positioning, display and float
  - Use `Active Record` | `Entity Framework` validations
  - Propagate validation errors up to the view
  - Try use RESTful routes ([example](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html#crud-verbs-and-actions)) (Sharpies Hint - WebApi)

### User Stories

We are going to create an online shopping cart.

- A user can view a list of products
- A user can view a product in more details on a different page
- A user can sign up
- A user can log in
- A user can select items from the products page to put into their shopping cart
- A user can remove items from their shopping cart
- A user can purchase items in their shopping cart (just a button no need to deal with credit card libraries)
